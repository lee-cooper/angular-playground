# Reative Forms Practice

## Challenge #1

Create a reactive form that handles a user's email address and password and outputs a formGroup that contains the user's values.

- Validate that the email address is in a valid format
- Hide password input on type, but capture actual password
- Make both form fields required
- Add Login Button
- Add an email icon prefix to the email
- Add a lock icon prefix to the password
- Prevent console.log unless the form is valid

Utilize Angular Material for this task.
