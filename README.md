# Angular Playground

A test repository to try out Angular concepts and practices.

## Commands

- `ng serve` - Start the dev server at `http://localhost:4200/`
- `ng build` - Build the project and store artifacts into the `dist/` directory
- `ng test` - Execute unit tests via [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).
- `ng lint` - Runs ESlint on the project

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
